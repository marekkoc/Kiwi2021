# Kiwi Project 2021

This is an implementation of a kiwi fruit seeds image segmentation midter project descibed by prof. A. Lundervold during [BMED 2021 course](https://github.com/computational-medicine/BMED360-2021/tree/main/Midterm-Kiwi-Project). 

The 3D dataset, consisting of 128 transaxial slices through the long axis of the kiwi, was acquired with the 7 T Bruker Pharmascan MRI scanner at the Molecular Imaging Center (MIC/Vivarium), University of Bergen, using the 2D RARE pulse sequence (Echo Train Length = 8, TR = 18520 ms, TE = 63.9 ms, No. of Averages = 2, Flip Angle = 180 deg, Slice thickness = 0.5 mm, In-plane pixel resolution = 0.234 x 0.234 mm$^2$, Acquisition matrix = 256 x 256, Number of slices = 128).
